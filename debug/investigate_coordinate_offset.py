"""
Investigation script for the 0.5-pixel coordinate offset bug between PIL and OpenCV.

This script was used to diagnose and verify the fix for the coordinate system mismatch
where PIL treats integer coordinates as pixel centers while OpenCV treats them as corners.

Generated during coordinate system bug investigation - December 2024.
