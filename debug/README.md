# Debug Directory

This directory contains debugging utilities and scripts developed while investigating differences between PIL/torchvision and OpenCV transform implementations.

## Main Debug Utilities

### `debug_utils.py`
Consolidated debugging functions from various investigation sessions:

- `compare_contrast_outputs()` - Compare PIL and OpenCV contrast results
- `debug_contrast_formula()` - Debug exact formula calculations
- `analyze_pil_precision_issue()` - Analyze PIL's precision bugs
- `create_contrast_test_summary()` - Test multiple contrast factors
- `test_beans_dataset_image()` - Test with the actual failing test image

Example usage:
```python
from debug.debug_utils import compare_contrast_outputs, test_beans_dataset_image

# Test specific image
import numpy as np
image = np.random.randint(0, 256, (100, 100), dtype=np.uint8)
result = compare_contrast_outputs(image, contrast_factor=0.5)

# Or test with the actual test fixture image
test_beans_dataset_image()
```

### `debug_rotation.py`
Comprehensive rotation transform debugging utilities:

- `analyze_rotation_differences()` - Analyze differences between PIL and OpenCV rotation
- `test_random_rotation_sync()` - Test RandomRotation synchronization
- `test_interpolation_modes()` - Compare different interpolation modes
- `visualize_rotation_difference()` - Create visual comparison plots
- `run_full_analysis()` - Run comprehensive rotation analysis

Example usage:
```python
from debug.debug_rotation import analyze_rotation_differences, run_full_analysis

# Quick analysis
result = analyze_rotation_differences(angle=30, use_test_image=True)

# Full comprehensive analysis
run_full_analysis()
```

## Individual Debug Scripts

These scripts were created during the investigation of contrast transform failures:

- `debug_contrast*.py` - Various approaches to debugging contrast
- `debug_pil*.py` - Understanding PIL's implementation details
- `debug_blend_formula.py` - Testing different blend formulas
- `final_debug.py` - Final debugging session results

## Key Findings

### Contrast Transform
1. PIL has precision issues where `contrast_factor=1.0` doesn't always return the original image
2. Differences are typically Â±1 pixel value for <0.01% of pixels
3. PIL uses `int(value + 0.5)` for rounding
4. The mean value calculation is critical for matching PIL behavior

### Rotation Transform
1. PIL/torchvision uses PyTorch's random generator, while opencv_transforms now uses it too for compatibility
2. Default interpolation is NEAREST for both PIL and OpenCV implementations
3. Small differences (<1% of pixels) occur at edges due to different rotation algorithms
4. Mean pixel differences are typically 2-8 out of 255, indicating good overall accuracy
5. Both libraries rotate counter-clockwise by default
